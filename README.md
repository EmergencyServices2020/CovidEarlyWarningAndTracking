# CovidEarlyWarningAndTracking
A Android App to track people GPS location and send warnings when someone who was in close proximity and register as have symptoms. No personal data just a phone IMEI scrambled. 
The whole system is consist of a Web service to receive the location together with the IMEI. And calculate the location. 
The android app is simple, the user have 3 options, one is to register symptoms, second is to register as positive. 
And the last is to see alerts. Alerts is based on his location and close contact with people who clicked the button that are registered as possible or confirmed cases. 
I already start develop the Web service. 
Need help on the android app.
